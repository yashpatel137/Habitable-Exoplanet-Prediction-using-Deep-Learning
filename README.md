# Habitable-Exoplanet-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

Mankind has been looking up at the stars for centuries, wondering what lies out there in deep space, and if there are other civilizations like ours that exists.

Since the beginning of cosmological expansion, the observable universe is estimated to be about the diameter of 93 billion light years. In this vast cosmic space, there might be a higher probability of the existence of earth size celestial bodies or similar habitable zones. This popular interest led to embracing the vision to explore our Milky Way galaxy. In 2009, NASA launched the Kepler Space Telescope which studied a small patch of area which consists of about half million stars. Our proposed way to detect habitability consists of statistical approach by using Deep-learning algorithms on Kepler and TESS dataset. Our prime centre is to build the increased set of parameters over which habitability of an exoplanet depends and furthermore utilizing a dataset with an increased set of the star systems which will additionally bring about expanded precision and accuracy of the prediction.<br>

## Platform Used

Platform used for this project is Jupyter Notebook of Anaconda.<br>
To run ‘keras’ library we need to make new environment in anacondas jupyter notebook as keras is not supported in default environment.

## Libraries Required

Libraries used in this project are:<br>
•	Pandas<br>
•	Matplotlib<br>
•	Seaborn<br>
•	SKlearn<br>
•	Numpy<br>
•	Keras<br>
•	TensorFlow<br>
